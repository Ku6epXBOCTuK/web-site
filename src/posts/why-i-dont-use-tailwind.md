## Why I’ve Moved Away from Tailwind: The Problem with Mixing Concerns

In the modern web development landscape, **Tailwind CSS** has become the industry darling for rapid prototyping. However, as projects scale and long-term maintainability becomes the priority, the "utility-first" philosophy reveals a significant flaw: it fundamentally violates the principle of **Separation of Concerns** by merging HTML structure with visual styling.

### The Return of Inline Styles

Decades were spent moving away from inline styles toward semantic, organized CSS. Tailwind feels like a regression. By using classes like `flex items-center justify-between p-4`, we are essentially writing inline styles using shorthand aliases.

When styles are tightly coupled to the HTML:

- **Readability Suffers:** Simple components become obscured by a "wall of text," making it difficult to scan the document's structure.
- **Maintenance Debt:** Updating a design system—such as global padding or border-radius—often requires searching and replacing strings across hundreds of files instead of updating a single rule in a stylesheet.

### The SvelteKit Advantage: Scoped Styles

Using **SvelteKit** offers a much more elegant solution: **Scoped Styles**. This feature allows for writing clean, component-specific CSS that is automatically isolated to that component.

- **Semantic HTML:** My markup remains clean and meaningful. Instead of a dozen utility classes, I use descriptive names that reflect the element's purpose.
- **No "Leakage":** Svelte ensures that styles inside a component never "leak" out or affect other parts of the application.
- **Native Power:** I am not restricted by Tailwind’s predefined classes. If a design requires a complex grid or a unique animation, I can write it in native CSS without fighting a framework.

### Modern Compatibility with PostCSS

Choosing clean CSS doesn't mean sacrificing modern tooling or browser support. By integrating **PostCSS** into the SvelteKit pipeline:

- **Legacy Support:** Plugins like _Autoprefixer_ ensure that my clean CSS works perfectly on older browsers by automatically adding the necessary vendor prefixes.
- **Future-Proofing:** I can use the latest CSS features (like nesting or custom media queries) today, knowing they will be processed correctly for the end user.

### The Loss of Semantic Meaning

CSS was designed to define _what_ an element is (e.g., `.user-profile-avatar`), while the stylesheet defines _how_ it looks. Tailwind forces the HTML to describe the appearance, stripping away the semantic layer. For a developer entering a project, "decoding" a string of 15 utility classes to understand a `div`'s purpose increases cognitive load and slows down the onboarding process.

### Complex State Management

While frameworks handle logic well, Tailwind adds unnecessary complexity to conditional styling:

- **Template Mess:** Managing `hover`, `active`, or `disabled` states often leads to cluttered template literals or messy string manipulation logic.
- **Visual Drift:** In team environments, the lack of a centralized stylesheet makes it easy for the "visual language" to drift as different developers use slightly different utility combinations for the same UI patterns.

### Final Thoughts

Tailwind CSS is an impressive tool for getting a project off the ground. However, for developers who value **clean HTML**, **semantic structure**, and **predictable maintenance**, the architectural cost of mixing concerns is too high. The native power of SvelteKit combined with PostCSS proves that we can build modern, scalable web applications while keeping our code organized and our concerns separated.
