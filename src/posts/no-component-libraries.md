The transition from using massive UI libraries to writing custom styles is a common evolution for developers seeking more control and performance. Based on my recent work with SvelteKit templates and the **XBOCT-page** extension, here is why I’ve moved away from "off-the-shelf" UI frameworks.

## The Weight of Convenience: Why I Quit UI Libraries

For years, the go-to move for any new project was to install a UI library like MUI, Vuetify, or Bootstrap. They promised speed and a professional look out of the box. However, after building several projects—including my own custom browser extension and a high-performance SvelteKit template—I realized these libraries often cost more than they save.

### 1. The "Bloat" Problem

UI libraries are designed to be everything to everyone. When you install one, you aren't just getting a button; you're getting 500 variations of that button, plus modals, sliders, and date pickers you’ll never use. This leads to:

- **Bundle Bloat:** Even with tree-shaking, these libraries increase the final JavaScript and CSS size.
- **Dependency Hell:** You become tied to the library's update cycle, which can break your project when a new version of the base framework (like Svelte 5) is released.

### 2. The Battle Against "The Brand"

Most UI libraries have a very distinct look. If you want your project to look unique, you spend hours "fighting" the library’s default CSS. Overriding deep nested styles often leads to using `!important` or complex selectors, which makes the codebase brittle. I’ve found it much cleaner to use **CSS Variables** and native styling to build exactly what I need from the start.

### 3. Performance and the "White Screen"

As I noted during the development of my **XBOCT-page** extension, speed is everything. UI libraries often rely on complex runtime logic to handle styles (CSS-in-JS), which can delay the initial render.

- **Offline-First:** By moving away from heavy libraries, I can ensure my projects load instantly from local storage without waiting for a massive framework to initialize.
- **Static Simplicity:** In my SvelteKit template, I prioritize the **static adapter**, which works best when the CSS is lean and predictable.

### 4. Custom Tooling for Better Quality

Instead of relying on a library to keep things consistent, I now use custom automated tools. For example, in my latest projects, I use a **CSS Variables Linter**.

- It ensures that I don't use undefined variables.
- It warns me if I have unused styles bloating my file.
  This gives me the consistency of a UI library without the unnecessary overhead.

## Conclusion

Building without a UI library requires more effort upfront—you have to build your own "bricks." However, the result is a project that is faster, easier to maintain, and truly under your control. Whether it’s a browser extension or a static site, the freedom from "black-box" dependencies is worth the extra code.
